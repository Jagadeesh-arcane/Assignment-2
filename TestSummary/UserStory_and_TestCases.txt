USER STORY:

As a user, I want to verify that the area calculator correctly computes the area of geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, and triangle) 
under various conditions, ensuring accurate results and appropriate error handling, so that I can rely on the calculator for precise 
calculations and robust behavior.


TEST CASES:

Circle Test 1:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 2.
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 12 square units.

Circle Test 2:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a circle with a negative radius (-2).
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 0, as a negative radius is not valid.

Rectangle Test 1:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 4 units and width 8 units.
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 32 square units.

Rectangle Test 2:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a rectangle with length 0 units and width 3 units.
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 0, as the length or width cannot be zero.

Triangle Test 1:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 6 units and height of 2 units.
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 6 square units.

Triangle Test 2:
Scenario: Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 7 units and height of 0 units.
Expected Result: The calculated area should be 0, as the height cannot be zero in a triangle.
